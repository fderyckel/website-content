abstract: How philosophy has conceptualized time throughout history. The audience will travel in time to discover 
  how Greek philosophers already devised linear and cyclical conceptions of times, the medieval times, the advent of Islam, 
  and how thinkers are adding a transcendental connotation to the idea of time. To then discover how with the modernity, 
  the concepts of times and techniques become linked together (humans become the "masters and possessors of nature"). With 
  the eminence of technology, humans then use philosophy as a tool to prevent the sophistic misappropriation of 
  the discourse (logos) on technic. Finally, this lecture will focus on the concept of speed and slowness and 
  will evaluate the promises of modernity and technology in light of these ideas.
